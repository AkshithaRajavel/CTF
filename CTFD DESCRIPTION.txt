ENCODED -100
Not encrypted....Just encoded
FLAG : 756265726374667b646f3530787864756c6a7d

ENCODED_2 -100
can u recognize the format ??
It's really popular...
FLAG : dWJlcmN0ZntxamhwODR0eHZtfQ==

HASHED - 100
Hash functions are not reversible. 
Really??
FLAG : uberctf{9330d0adaa891f9cb38f3692eef9a190c1b0ebe4f45f877b68366c808356bd9c}

ROUND&ROUND_WE_GO - 200
It's finite .... Trust me 
 
                                             FORENSICS

DATABASE - 300

U might have to solve the logs challenge to get this one done !!

LOGS - 200

OOPS! We deleted the flag by mistake....
But we found  command line logs. Can u find the flag with that ?

NETCAP - 100

There is a server distributing the flag...Can u find it ?

                     REVERSE ENGINEERING

ASSEMBLY - 200

Not familiar with assembly?
No problem .... You don't really need that.

SHIFT_IT - 100

Not exactly a crypto challenge !

Can u decrypt the flag reversing the source code of what encrypted it ???

encrypted flag : "f{j61=/:r!(9)jkk861"

SHIFT IT 2 - 300

Good with disassembling ?? Then it should be easy to crack !!

XOR - 100

Know how xor works ? 
U can crack this on any OS !! 
encrypted flag : '8b1707171117121d190b19125b49435202514f'

XOR 2 - 300

Found the encrypted flag ?? Then u need not randomly guess !


                   STEGANOGRAPHY

BINARY -100

Not a reverse engineering challenge ....
Don't think too much !

MALWARE -100

Not malicious... It just has the flag hidden

MALWARE 2 -200

Again !!! 
Not malicious... It just has the flag embedded in it
